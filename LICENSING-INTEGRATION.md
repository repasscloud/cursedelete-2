# Licensing.Core Integration Guide

**Audience:** this file is written for two readers at once — you (the human), who
should skim the numbered sections for the business/product picture, and a Claude
Code session working in a *separate* CLI-application repo, which should treat
sections 3–10 as an implementation spec and section 10 as its task list.

**Source of truth:** everything below was verified against the actual code in
`danijeljw-RPC/licsense-server-poc` (this repo) on 2026-08-16, not guessed from
the package name. File/line references let you re-verify anything.

---

## 1. What this system is

Three pieces, one repo (this one), one shared library:

| Component | What it does | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **LicenseServer** | ASP.NET Core app: Stripe billing → license issuance, online activation API, admin UI, transactional email | `src/LicenseServer` |
| **LicenseGenerator** | Offline CLI an *admin* runs to hand-sign a license file without the server (key management, manual/offline issuance) | `src/LicenseGenerator` |
| **Licensing.Core** | The NuGet package. Offline, no-network license *verification*. This is what your CLI app references. | `src/Licensing.Core` |

Your CLI app never talks to `LicenseGenerator` or the server's database — it only
does two things: (a) optionally call the server's public HTTP activation API, and
(b) verify the signed license file it ends up with, using `Licensing.Core`. Both
paths converge on the same artifact: a signed JSON "license envelope" file sitting
on disk next to (or near) your app.

---

## 2. The end-to-end human flow

### 2.1 Purchase → license issuance → email

1. Customer buys a plan in your shop; Stripe Checkout runs.
2. Stripe fires a webhook at the license server
   (`POST /api/v1/integrations/stripe/webhook`).
3. The server maps the Stripe price to a product/edition/license-type
   (`BillingPolicies.cs`), creates a `BillingContract` + `LicenseOrder`, and
   **issues a license record**: a `licenseId` and a random **activation code**
   (the activation code is hashed server-side with HMAC-SHA256 + a pepper —
   the plaintext only ever exists in this one email).
4. The server queues a transactional email, template `purchase-activation`
   (`TransactionalEmail.cs:19`), containing exactly:
   - `licenseId`
   - `activationCode`

   This is the **only** email template allowed to carry a plaintext activation
   code — it's enforced in code (`TransactionalEmail.cs:83-85`).

The customer now has two strings: a **License ID** and an **Activation Code**.
That's all they need to activate.

### 2.2 Online activation (app has network access to the license server)

This is the common case. Your app:

1. Computes a local **device identity** (see §4.6).
2. Generates a `requestId` (GUID) and a random `activationToken` (32 bytes,
   Base64) — both client-side, both kept locally afterward.
3. `POST {licenseServerBaseUrl}/api/v1/licenses/{licenseId}/activate` with the
   license ID, activation code, request id, activation token, device info,
   `mode: "online"`.
4. Server returns a **signed license envelope** (`SignedLicense`) plus
   `refreshAfter` / `leaseExpiresAt` timestamps. Your app writes the envelope
   to disk and verifies it locally with `Licensing.Core`.
5. Your app must call the **refresh** endpoint again before `leaseExpiresAt`
   (ideally around `refreshAfter`) to get a renewed envelope. If it doesn't,
   `LicenseVerifier.ValidateActivation` will start rejecting the stored file
   once the lease expires — this is a deliberate "phone home periodically"
   mechanic, not a bug to work around.

Full request/response contracts are in §6.

### 2.3 Offline activation (air-gapped machine, no network)

This is the flow you described — request JSON out, signed license file back,
by email, manually. It is a real, already-scripted flow
(`scripts/new-offline-activation-request.sh`), not something to invent:

1. Your app builds the **exact same JSON shape** as the online request, except
   `mode: "offline"`, and instead of POSTing it, **writes it to a file** (e.g.
   `offline-activation-request.json`) because the machine has no network path
   to the license server.
2. The user emails that file to **hello@repasscloud.com** (or wherever you
   route support intake).
3. A human admin (who *does* have network access) takes that JSON and calls
   the same `POST /api/v1/licenses/{licenseId}/activate` endpoint on the
   customer's behalf, with `mode: "offline"` — this produces an activation
   with **no lease** (`refreshAfter`/`leaseExpiresAt` are both null for
   offline mode; see `LicenseStore.cs:349-350`), so it never needs to phone
   home again.
4. The admin relays the resulting signed license JSON back to the customer
   by email as a file (e.g. `customer.license`).
5. The customer drops that file into the directory your app expects (see
   §4.6/§10 for where). Your app calls `LicenseVerifier.VerifyFile(path)` —
   zero network calls from here on.

Note what does **not** change between online and offline: the activation code,
the request/response JSON shape, and the verification code. Only the transport
(HTTP call vs. email round-trip) and the lease behavior differ.

*(There's a second offline path admins use for hand-issued licenses — e.g. an
education or enterprise deal signed with no Stripe purchase at all, via the
`LicenseGenerator` CLI and `POST /api/v1/admin/licenses/import`. That's purely
an admin/ops concern; your CLI app's job is identical either way — verify
whatever signed file lands on disk.)*

### 2.4 Renewal, deactivation, transfer

- **Subscription** licenses renew automatically via Stripe webhooks
  (`invoice.payment_*`), which extend `expiresAt` server-side — no customer
  action needed, but the *activation lease* (online mode) still needs its own
  periodic refresh call, independent of billing.
- **Deactivating** (e.g. before uninstalling, or moving to a new machine) calls
  `POST /api/v1/activations/{activationId}/deactivate`. A license only allows
  one active activation at a time; activating on a new device while one is
  already active is rejected until the old one is deactivated (transfer flow,
  `LicenseStore.cs:326-334`).

---

## 3. Getting the Licensing.Core package

**It is not on nuget.org.** `NuGet.Config` in this repo only lists nuget.org as
a source, but `Licensing.Core` itself is published as a **GitHub Release
artifact**, built by `.github/workflows/release-image.yml`:

- Latest tagged release: **v0.2.1** (`Licensing.Core.0.2.1.nupkg`).
- Release page: `https://github.com/danijeljw-RPC/licsense-server-poc/releases/tag/v0.2.1`
- Assets per release: the `.nupkg`, a plain-DLL `.zip` and `.tar.gz`, and
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` covering all of them — verify against it before trusting
  the download.

Two ways to consume it in the other repo:

**A. Local NuGet feed pointed at the downloaded `.nupkg` (recommended):**
```bash
mkdir -p ./nuget-local
curl -L -o ./nuget-local/Licensing.Core.0.2.1.nupkg \
  https://github.com/danijeljw-RPC/licsense-server-poc/releases/download/v0.2.1/Licensing.Core.0.2.1.nupkg
# verify against SHA256SUMS.txt from the same release before using it
```
Add a `<packageSources>` entry for `./nuget-local` in the new repo's
`NuGet.Config`, then:
```bash
dotnet add package Licensing.Core --version 0.2.1
```

**B. Plain DLL reference:** download/verify the `.zip`/`.tar.gz`, drop
`Licensing.Core.dll` somewhere in the repo, and add a `<Reference>` to it in
the `.csproj`. Works, but loses NuGet version tracking — prefer A.

Target framework is **net10.0**; your CLI app needs to target net10.0 (or a
TFM the DLL is compatible with) to reference it.

**Key-rotation implication:** `TrustedPublicKeys` is compiled into the package
(`src/Licensing.Core/TrustedPublicKeys.cs`) — currently trusts key IDs
`primary-2026` and `secondary-2026`. If this repo rotates signing keys again,
licenses signed after that rotation won't verify against an older
`Licensing.Core` build. Pin the version deliberately and bump it when told a
rotation happened — don't silently float to "latest."

## 4. Core concepts & data model

### 4.1 Signed license envelope (the actual file on disk)

```json
{
  "format": "software-license-v1",
  "algorithm": "ECDSA-P256-SHA256",
  "keyId": "primary-2026",
  "license": {
    "licenseId": "LIC-ABC123",
    "customer": "Acme Pty Ltd",
    "issuedAt": "2026-08-12T06:30:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "contactEmail": "buyer@example.com",
      "purchaseOrder": "PO-001"
    },
    "deviceBinding": {
      "scheme": "os-machine-id-sha256-v1",
      "deviceId": "<64-hex SHA-256>",
      "deviceName": "buyers-laptop"
    },
    "activation": {
      "activationId": "b3f1...-guid",
      "mode": "online",
      "activatedAt": "2026-08-12T06:31:00Z",
      "refreshAfter": "2026-08-13T06:31:00Z",
      "leaseExpiresAt": "2026-08-19T06:31:00Z"
    },
    "entitlements": [
      {
        "product": "your-app-code",
        "edition": "business",
        "licenseType": "subscription",
        "seats": 5,
        "expiresAt": "2027-08-12T06:30:00Z",
        "updatesUntil": "2028-12-31"
      }
    ]
  },
  "signature": "base64..."
}
```

Rules worth knowing (all enforced by `LicenseSchema.Parse`,
`src/Licensing.Core/LicenseSchema.cs`):
- `deviceBinding` and `activation` are both present or both absent — never one
  without the other.
- `entitlements` is a non-empty array, at most one entry per `product`.
- `metadata` values must be string/number/boolean only (no nesting), keys must
  be lowerCamelCase.
- All timestamps must carry an explicit timezone offset (`Z` or `+HH:MM`).
- Unknown top-level fields are rejected outright — this schema is strict, not
  extensible by convention. If you need to carry app-specific data, put it in
  `metadata`.

### 4.2 C# types Licensing.Core exposes (namespace `SoftwareLicensing`)

```csharp
LicenseVerifier.VerifyFile(path)              // -> VerifiedLicense
LicenseVerifier.Verify(json)                  // -> VerifiedLicense
LicenseVerifier.ValidateProduct(verified, product, releaseDate?, currentTimeUtc?, currentDevice?)
                                               // -> ProductEntitlement (throws if not entitled/expired)
LicenseVerifier.ValidateActivation(verified, currentDevice?, currentTimeUtc?)
                                               // called automatically by ValidateProduct

record VerifiedLicense(string KeyId, LicenseData Data);
record LicenseData(string LicenseId, string Customer, DateTimeOffset IssuedAt,
    JsonObject? Metadata, DeviceBinding? DeviceBinding, ActivationData? Activation,
    IReadOnlyList<ProductEntitlement> Entitlements, JsonObject Json);
record ProductEntitlement(string Product, string Edition, string LicenseType,
    int Seats, DateTimeOffset? ExpiresAt, DateOnly? UpdatesUntil, JsonObject Json);
record DeviceBinding(string Scheme, string DeviceId, string? DeviceName, JsonObject Json);
record ActivationData(string ActivationId, string Mode, DateTimeOffset ActivatedAt,
    DateTimeOffset? RefreshAfter, DateTimeOffset? LeaseExpiresAt, JsonObject Json);

DeviceIdentity.GetCurrent()                   // -> LocalDeviceIdentity
DeviceIdentity.IsValidDeviceId(value)

class LicenseValidationException : Exception  // signature/expiry/entitlement/activation failures
class LicenseSchemaException : Exception      // malformed license JSON
```

### 4.3 Terminology mapping — read this carefully

Your message used "license type" for what the code calls **`edition`**, and
"perpetual vs time-expiring" for what the code calls **`licenseType`**. Two
genuinely different fields, both on every entitlement:

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `edition` | `community`, `project`, `education`, `consumer`, `business`, `smb`, `enterprise`, `corporate` (`ProductCatalog.cs:11-15`) | **Which feature tier** — drives feature gating |
| `licenseType` | `perpetual`, `subscription`, `evaluation` (`LicenseTerms.cs:5-8`) | **Time model** — drives expiry behavior |

Use `edition` for "what can this customer do." Use `licenseType` (via
`expiresAt`) for "is this license still valid right now."

### 4.4 Perpetual vs time-expiring

- `perpetual`: server sets `expiresAt` to a sentinel far-future timestamp
  (`9999-12-31T23:59:59.9999999Z`, `LicenseTerms.cs:10-11`) — a real value, not
  null, so your expiry check is uniform: just compare `entitlement.ExpiresAt`
  against now. Don't special-case "perpetual == no expiry field" in your app;
  the field is always populated.
- `subscription` / `evaluation`: `expiresAt` is a real, meaningful deadline.
  `subscription` gets pushed forward automatically by Stripe renewal webhooks;
  `evaluation` does not.
- `updatesUntil` (optional, date-only) is separate from `expiresAt` — it gates
  whether a specific *release* is covered, not whether the license itself is
  valid. Only relevant if you ship dated releases and want to enforce "your
  license covers updates through 2028-12-31." Pass your build's release date
  into `ValidateProduct(..., releaseDate: ...)` if you use this; omit it if
  you don't need per-release gating.

`ValidateProduct` throws `LicenseValidationException` automatically if
`expiresAt` has passed — you don't check it yourself.

### 4.5 How your app identifies itself in the license

There is **no separate "app name" field**. Identity is the `product` string on
each entitlement — a stable, lowercase code (regex `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,99}$`,
enforced server-side in `LicenseImport.cs` and `ProductCatalog.cs`), e.g.
`"gcexp"` in this repo's demo data. A single license file can hold
entitlements for multiple products; your app finds *its own* by matching this
code.

**Action for the CLI app:** pick one stable product code for it (e.g.
`"my-cli-tool"`), hardcode it as a constant, and always call:
```csharp
var entitlement = LicenseVerifier.ValidateProduct(verified, product: "my-cli-tool");
```
That same string must be registered as a `ProductDefinition.Code` on the
license server (admin creates it via `POST /api/v1/admin/products`) and used
consistently in every license-data JSON an admin hand-signs, and in the Stripe
price → product mapping for purchases. Get this string agreed between you and
whoever administers the license server before writing code against it — a
mismatch here means every license silently fails `ValidateProduct` with "no
entitlement for X," which reads like a broken license rather than a config
typo.

### 4.6 Device binding — and its real limitation

`DeviceIdentity.GetCurrent()` (`src/Licensing.Core/DeviceIdentity.cs`) hashes a
per-OS "stable" identifier:
- Windows: registry `MachineGuid`
- Linux: `/etc/machine-id` or `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id`
- Fallback (macOS, or anything else): `Environment.MachineName` — noticeably
  weaker and explicitly flagged as such in `Source` (`"machine-name-fallback"`)

The doc comment is explicit: *"a useful PoC binding, not an unspoofable
hardware root of trust."* Tell whoever's evaluating security posture that
device binding here is a deterrent against casual license sharing, not a
DRM-grade guarantee — especially since the fallback path (relevant if this CLI
ships for macOS) binds to a trivially-changeable machine name.

---

## 5. Verifying a license file (do this every time the app starts)

```csharp
using SoftwareLicensing;

try
{
    var verified = LicenseVerifier.VerifyFile(licensePath);           // signature + schema
    var entitlement = LicenseVerifier.ValidateProduct(                // entitlement + expiry + device/lease
        verified,
        product: "my-cli-tool");

    // Trusted from here on:
    UnlockFeaturesFor(entitlement.Edition);   // see §8
    // entitlement.Seats, entitlement.ExpiresAt, entitlement.UpdatesUntil also available
}
catch (LicenseValidationException ex)
{
    // Signature bad, wrong device, expired, no entitlement, lease expired, etc.
    // Do not unlock. Show ex.Message — it's already written to be user-facing.
}
```

No public key handling, no network call, no server dependency in this path —
that's the entire point of shipping `Licensing.Core` as a package instead of
hand-rolling verification in every consuming app.

---

## 6. Online activation — HTTP contracts

Licensing.Core does **not** ship these DTOs (they live in the server's own
`ApiContracts.cs`, internal to that project). Define matching POCOs in the CLI
repo — shapes below are copied verbatim from the server's actual contracts.

Base URL is whatever the license server is deployed at — dev default is
`http://localhost:8080` (`appsettings.json:35`); production URL is a config
value your app needs, not something to hardcode.

### 6.1 Activate — `POST {baseUrl}/api/v1/licenses/{licenseId}/activate`

Request:
```json
{
  "requestId": "<new GUID, string>",
  "activationCode": "<from the purchase email>",
  "activationToken": "<32 random bytes, Base64>",
  "mode": "online",
  "device": {
    "scheme": "os-machine-id-sha256-v1",
    "deviceId": "<DeviceIdentity.GetCurrent().DeviceId>",
    "deviceName": "<optional, e.g. Environment.MachineName>"
  }
}
```
`activationToken` **must** be exactly 32 random bytes, Base64-encoded, or the
server rejects the request (`LicenseStore.cs:826-830`). Generate it with
`RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes(32)` → `Convert.ToBase64String(...)`.

Response (`200 OK`):
```json
{
  "licenseId": "LIC-ABC123",
  "activationId": "guid",
  "status": "active",
  "signedLicense": "<the full signed envelope from §4.1, as a JSON string>",
  "refreshAfter": "2026-08-13T06:31:00Z",
  "leaseExpiresAt": "2026-08-19T06:31:00Z"
}
```
**Persist locally and durably:** `activationId`, `activationToken` (the one
*you* generated — the server never returns it, it only ever echoes back what
you already have), and the `signedLicense` written to your license file path.
The `activationToken` is a bearer credential for validate/refresh/deactivate —
treat it like a password (e.g. OS keychain / protected local storage), not a
plaintext config file, if the platform offers one.

Non-2xx responses are a `Problem`-shaped error (bad activation code, license
already active elsewhere, license canceled/revoked, no signing key available,
etc.) — surface `title`/`detail` to the user; don't retry blindly on 4xx.

### 6.2 Validate — `POST {baseUrl}/api/v1/activations/{activationId}/validate`
```json
{ "activationToken": "<stored>", "deviceId": "<recomputed each call, not stored>" }
```
Cheap liveness/status check; does not return a new signed license.

### 6.3 Refresh — `POST {baseUrl}/api/v1/activations/{activationId}/refresh`

Same request body as validate. Returns the same shape as Activate's response —
a **new** `signedLicense` and pushed-out `refreshAfter`/`leaseExpiresAt`.
**Overwrite the on-disk license file with this response.** Only valid for
`mode: "online"` activations — calling it for an offline-mode activation
returns a conflict (`LicenseStore.cs:418-419`), which is expected, not a bug.

Call this on a schedule (e.g. at app startup if past `refreshAfter`, or a
background timer) well before `leaseExpiresAt`, with retry/backoff for
transient network failure — the whole point of the lease window is slack for
"was offline for a few days," not a hard cliff at first missed check-in.

### 6.4 Deactivate — `POST {baseUrl}/api/v1/activations/{activationId}/deactivate`

Same request body as validate. Frees the seat so the license can be activated
on another device. Call this from an explicit "deactivate"/"sign out" command
in your CLI, and ideally from an uninstaller, though the latter is best-effort
(can't guarantee network access at uninstall time).

---

## 7. Offline activation request (air-gapped path)

Same fields as §6.1's request, `mode: "offline"` instead, written to a file
instead of POSTed:

```csharp
var device = DeviceIdentity.GetCurrent();
var request = new
{
    requestId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
    activationCode,                          // user-entered
    activationToken = Convert.ToBase64String(RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes(32)),
    mode = "offline",
    device = new { scheme = device.Scheme, deviceId = device.DeviceId, deviceName = device.DeviceName }
};
File.WriteAllText(outputPath, JsonSerializer.Serialize(request, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true }));
```

Tell the user, on-screen, after writing this file: email it to
**hello@repasscloud.com**, and once they receive a `.license` file back, save
it to the path your app expects (§10) and re-run the app.

**Persist the same `activationToken` locally** as in the online path — the
admin's relayed license won't include it, but you'll need it later if this
license is ever moved to online mode or you add a manual "check status"
command against the admin-run activation record.

---

## 8. Feature gating by edition

`Licensing.Core` deliberately does **not** enforce feature flags — it only
tells you the truth about the license (edition, seats, expiry). Your app owns
the feature matrix:

```csharp
static readonly IReadOnlyDictionary<string, FeatureSet> FeaturesByEdition = new Dictionary<string, FeatureSet>
{
    ["community"]  = FeatureSet.Basic,
    ["project"]    = FeatureSet.Basic | FeatureSet.Reporting,
    ["education"]  = FeatureSet.Basic | FeatureSet.Reporting,
    ["consumer"]   = FeatureSet.Basic,
    ["business"]   = FeatureSet.Basic | FeatureSet.Reporting | FeatureSet.MultiSeat,
    ["smb"]        = FeatureSet.Basic | FeatureSet.Reporting | FeatureSet.MultiSeat,
    ["enterprise"] = FeatureSet.All,
    ["corporate"]  = FeatureSet.All,
};
```
(Illustrative — define whatever the product actually needs.) Look this up with
`entitlement.Edition` after a successful `ValidateProduct` call. Treat an
edition string that isn't in your map as "no features" (fail closed), not as a
crash — new editions can be added server-side without a client release.

---

## 9. Error handling

- `LicenseSchemaException` — malformed license JSON. Should only happen with a
  corrupted/tampered file; treat as "reject the license," not a crash.
- `LicenseValidationException` — the catch-all for "this license is not
  currently valid to use": bad signature, unknown/revoked signing key, wrong
  device, expired entitlement, no entitlement for this product, expired
  activation lease. Message text is already written to be shown to a user.
- Network layer (online activation only): timeouts and non-2xx HTTP responses
  are yours to handle — this is ordinary HTTP client code, nothing
  license-specific about it except: don't treat a network failure as "license
  invalid," treat it as "couldn't check right now" and fall back to the
  last-verified local file until the lease actually expires.

---

## 10. Checklist for the Claude Code session implementing this

1. Add `Licensing.Core` 0.2.1 as a package reference (§3) — verify the
   `.nupkg` against `SHA256SUMS.txt` before adding it to the local feed.
2. Pick and hardcode this app's product code (agree it with the license-server
   admin first — see §4.5). Ask the user for it if not already decided; don't
   invent one.
3. Decide and hardcode/config the license server base URL (dev vs prod) and
   the license file's on-disk location (e.g.
   `%APPDATA%/<app>/license.json` / `~/.config/<app>/license.json` /
   next to the executable — platform-appropriate, not a fixed absolute path).
4. Implement license verification at startup per §5, gating features per §8.
5. Implement the online activation command: prompt for License ID + Activation
   Code, build and POST the §6.1 request, persist `activationId` +
   `activationToken` securely, write `signedLicense` to the license file.
6. Implement a refresh routine per §6.3 (startup check + background timer),
   only for `mode: "online"` activations.
7. Implement the offline path: same prompts, write the §7 request file
   instead of POSTing, tell the user to email it to hello@repasscloud.com and
   where to place the returned `.license` file.
8. Implement a deactivate command per §6.4.
9. Wire all of the above through `LicenseValidationException`/
   `LicenseSchemaException` handling per §9 — never let a license failure
   crash the app; always fail to "not activated" with a clear message.
10. Do not reimplement signature verification, schema parsing, or public-key
    handling — that's exactly what `Licensing.Core` exists to centralize.
    If something about a license file looks wrong, that's a
    `LicenseValidationException`, not a reason to hand-parse the JSON.

---

## 11. Decisions only a human can make (don't guess these)

- The CLI app's **product code** (§4.5) — must match server-side config.
- Where the **license file lives on disk** per OS.
- The **license server's production base URL**.
- The actual **feature-to-edition matrix** (§8) — this doc gives the shape,
  not the business decision of what each tier unlocks.
- Whether activation credentials (`activationToken`) need OS-keychain-grade
  protection for this product, or a protected local file is acceptable.
